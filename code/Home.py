    # Overview

    **LLM utility tools** is a set of simple techniques and applications
    powered by a LLM (Large Language Model). They provide quality of life
    and/or improve efficiency in comon day to day office tasks.

    I started developing some of these as either learning exercises,
    for my own personal use or as examples of what can be done in the industry.
    The version published here are updated and designed for simplicity
    and easiness of use.

    Most of this techniques can be found on modern private AI assistants.
    Here, however, I aim to offer them as open source applications.
    The only restriction would be providing a LLM API.

    #### üó®Ô∏è Chat agent
    The chat agent is a simple bot interface agent between the LLM and you. 
    It has access to a toolset. Currently the toolset includes a web search
    capability powered by **DuckDuckGO**. 
    This makes it able to reply with reliable and updated data.
