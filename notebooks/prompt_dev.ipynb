    "\n",
    "Two methods of testing wellbores are used within the industry: FIT and leak-off test (LOT). The industry often confuses LOTs and FITs. But understanding the difference is important in appreciating the benefits of frequent dynamic FITs when drilling in trouble zones.\n",

    "\n",
    "A FIT is comparable to testing a pressure vessel to its rated operating pressure, which includes a safety factor and in which no damage to future pressure containment capability is expected. \n",

Language should be tailored to reflect and be appropriate to whomever is being communicated to, for example the business decision maker versus the tech decision maker. :unselected: We are trustworthy and dependable, and that can be validated by some of the accolades we have received and brand names we have as clients. But we need to give people reason to trust and believe what we say by demonstrating our knowledge and leader role in the industry. :unselected: We are successful, knowledgeable, expert, respected by our industry peers, accomplished and self-assured ... but we must never sound \\'cocksure\\' or arrogant. :unselected: We call ourselves pioneers because we are brave, bold, adventurous, curious and always willing to challenge. We see ourselves as disruptors, even maverick at times, and some might describe us as anti- establishment. We don\\'t just accept things as they are if we believe there is a better way to do things, but we are never belligerent or aggressive. Determined with self-belief yes, rail-roading never. :unselected: We are collaborators and partners. This means we are flexible, co-operative, open-minded and non-judgemental. We are extremely \\'human\\': friendly, approachable and accessible, not a faceless digital behemoth. We are proud of our playful, creative, sometimes quirky culture and personality. :unselected: We are \\'woke\\', passionate and caring. We genuinely believe that data can be used to build a better world and to improve outcomes on a local and global scale. We want to be a force for good and we lead by example. We care deeply about the welfare of our planet and humanity, firmly believing that we have an important role to play. :unselected: The language we use shouldn\\'t be overly jargon-heavy although the audience will generally be knowledgeable in the fields of data and technology so needs to be respectful and mindful of that (not condescending or too dumbed down). Text needs to talk the language of CIOs and data professionals, but also give them the language to speak to their CEO, CFO, Sustainability Officer or ESG Committee. It must strike a balance between clarity and over-simplification. :unselected: We always speak in the plural (we, us, \\'what we do\\', \\'who we are\\'). We can however refer to ourselves as Elastacloud and Elastaclouders.\\nOUR BRAND STORY\\nWe\\'re pioneering through data\\nElastacloud have always been data pioneers: unleashing the power hidden within data through the design and implementation of world-class, enterprise-grade solutions. We are accelerators, empowering businesses to get where they\\'re going securely, cost-effectively, and faster - often deploying within days and weeks, not months or years.\\nOur founders, Richard Conway and Andy Cross were the first pioneers; sharing an extraordinary talent for finding the hidden power and untapped opportunities in data and then unleashing its potential. If anyone said \"it can\\'t be done\", they said \"just watch us\", challenged the limits of what \\'other experts\\' claimed was possible and usually did it faster than anyone else.\\nThrough advanced analytics, data science, best practice development in Al and cloud data architectures - as well as research and development of sustainable business practice and green technologies - Elastacloud continue to pioneer through data to deliver accelerated transformation and game-changing insights and outcomes, fast.\\nThe Elastacloud way\\nSince 2011, we have been building our commitment to innovation, intelligent solutions and accelerated outcomes into a global business with teams of over 300 data experts across the UK, Spain, Brazil and India.\\nWe generally refer to our team members as \\'Elastaclouders\\'. Our Elastaclouders consist of some of the finest data technologist talent around, and serve as strategic advisors to several of the world\\'s leading brands. We are highly respected and accomplished leaders in the data industry, with Richard and Andy recognised as present Microsoft Regional Directors and retired Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals.\\nJust like our founders have always done, we look at things differently and are willing to push against convention to improve outcomes: pioneering through data to deliver more sustainable operations and elevate our clients with a competitive advantage and commercial edge. Whatever their objectives - from sustainability\\nand growth to transformation - we push the boundaries of possibility with a revolutionary approach and steely determination to unshackle their data and harness the opportunities it offers.\\nWe\\'re always searching for the beauty in data, operating at a granular level and getting \\'up-close\\' with it, so that we are able to identify and unlock the gateways that sit in plain sight. We look at every challenge from multiple perspectives, never losing sight of the bigger picture or of both micro and macro points of view.\\nWe love to solve big problems and give people the freedom to experiment, learn quickly, and share ideas with others. We see ourselves as challengers and disruptors, even maverick at times. We are not afraid of the unconventional and encourage our teams to take on big challenges that could fail, so we can learn and continue striving for breakthrough outcomes.\\nWe champion shared experience, innovation, collaboration, imagination, creativity, adventure, and opportunity. This is because we actively encourage our people to look for bold, alternative, and creative solutions - not just in delivery of our ground-breaking, data solutions for clients, but also through our unconventional recognition of the importance of play and imagination.\\nOne example of this is the way that Elastaclouders working across four countries are encouraged to participate and compete in company-wide \\'Dungeons & Dragons\\' tournaments, run by our own in-house Dungeon Master. Such gameplay enhances \\'out-of-the-box\\' thinking, problem solving and confidence building as well as strengthening relationships between teams.\\nIt\\'s all of this combined that gives us a unique \\'magic sauce\\'.\\nA culture of giving back\\nElastacloud firmly believes that data can break boundaries and benefit humanity, which is why we are heavily invested in projects and actions that improve outcomes for individuals and the planet. One way we do this is by empowering our Elastaclouders to contribute to the wider community through sharing their digital skills.\\nFor well over a decade, Elastacloud has established and maintained various industry user groups: joining together more than 12,000 people around the world for community- based learning and innovation. This includes one of the largest data science communities in Europe.\\nWe are also proud to sponsor computer labs at Shanti Bhavan, a residential school in India for children born into the lowest socioeconomic class, which aims to uplift from poverty through education and opportunity. Our team in India run coding labs for the students there, sometimes held in the Elastacloud offices.\\nElastacloud has a deeply embedded commitment to inclusivity, support, collaboration, nurturing and valuing its people. Across the world, we actively encourage Elastaclouders to find a healthy balance of work and personal life: promoting time for self, family and friends, for leisure and wellbeing. In India for example, we don\\'t allow our teams to consistently work outside of standard operating hours, despite this generally being the expectation that people experience within Indian corporate culture.\\nWe take on graduates and experienced individuals from all over (including from Shanti Bhavan) who possess the passion and mindset to make a difference. \\'Elastaclouders\\' are encouraged to invest at least an hour of their own time each month to mentor and support children, teaching them how to code and advance their IT literacy. This instils our graduates with a sense of community: ensuring that our values are passed on to more people and helping to embed sustainable social equity within the technologies we work in.\\nSince 2020, Elastacloud has been a foundation sponsor of The National Museum of Computing, which is based on the famous Bletchley Park estate where the Enigma code was cracked, turning the tide of the war. We\\'re active in a wide variety of events and activities at this inspiring educational venue; one that carries so much historical value and significance to our industry.\\nAlthough our Elastaclouders are widely spread geographically, we are united by a culture of pioneering for the greater good: harnessing data to break boundaries and benefit our people and our world.\\nOUR BRAND BOILERPLATES\\nBoilerplate - short version (60 words)\\nElastacloud are data pioneers, designing and delivering world-class, enterprise-grade solutions that unleash the power hidden within data. United by a culture of pioneering for the greater good, we fuse data science, intelligence, and innovation, to enable businesses to accelerate transformation, achieve strategic outcomes, meet goals faster, and benefit from the game-changing insights that their data can provide.\\nBoilerplate - longer version (409 words)\\nElastacloud are data pioneers, unleashing the power hidden within data through the design and implementation of world-class, enterprise-grade solutions.

These include: :unselected: Data square graphics :unselected: Data bridge graphics :unselected: Images :unselected: A combination of all of the above\\nThe following pages provide more insight about how these should be used.\\nDATA SQUARES\\nCan be made up of any of the colours in the approved brand palette. Can be single squares or adjacent squares touching on the corner points only, but never placed side by side. Squares can be used effectively as design features, as shown in \\'Five core messages\\' above.\\nDATA BRIDGE\\nA blend of colours from the approved palette. Instructions for how to replicate this effect are available.\\nOUR VISUAL LANGUAGE\\nElastacloud unleashes the power and opportunity hidden within data, through the design and implementation of world-class, enterprise-grade solutions. We use and connect data to build a better world and we\\'re always searching for the beauty in data. We operate at a granular level by getting \\'up-close\\' with data, so that we can identify and unlock the opportunities that lay hidden in plain sight. We look at every challenge from multiple perspectives, never losing a sense of the bigger picture or of both micro and macro points of view. We always apply the Elastacloud \\'magic sauce\\' to deliver accelerated outcomes.\\nThese sentiments should, wherever possible and appropriate, be represented through the unique styling of the visuals, brand assets and \\'hero\\' imagery that we use in external (and internal) communications and brand touch points (such as our website or sales and marketing material). The way we present our visual imagery is by implementing a combination of three key components:\\n1. Use of solid brand colour \\'data squares\\' to represent how Elastacloud intersects with and benefits our world (whilst directly echoing the two data squares that drop into the E of our logo).\\n2. Use of a distinctive brand asset that we refer to as a \\'data bridge\\'. This \\'rainbow- like\\' coloured line (comprising a blend of the Elastacloud colour palette) is a visual\\nrepresentation of data flowing between points and intersecting with smaller \\'data squares\\', overlaid on top of our hero images.\\n3. Use of exciting, intriguing, engaging, and stunningly detailed hero images of i) close-up nature shots and/or of ii) clients, people and industry. These images are interchangeable depending upon the context they are being presented in and what they are being used for, e.g. on a case study, sales deck or LinkedIn advert. Hero images can be either:\\ni) Close up images of nature to represent how Elastacloud gets up-close with data and operates at a granular level, to gain the understanding required to provide effective, fast solutions. We use super close-up natural images (flora and fauna: animals, birds, plants, food etc.), to reveal the hidden detail, colour, texture, pattern and beauty (as well as repetition and connection) that becomes apparent when magnified. This is a metaphor for how we work with data and is also a reflection of our sustainability focus. and/or\\nii) Macro images to reflect our client, people and industry expertise and experience, in order to show real-world applications of what we do and the impact we have on people and the planet.\\nUSE OF PHOTOGRAPHY\\nHere are some example nature and people/industry images incorporating the \\'data squares\\' and \\'data bridge\\' assets. A full gallery of images has been created and is available to be used in presentations and on the web.\\nWhich images should be used and where, is purely at the discretion of the designer or producer of the item. In real world applications or case studies, relevant images of people and industry may be most appropriate. When concepts are broader or more abstract, then nature images may work best. Images are interchangeable but consistently linked in visual language by the integration of the \\'data squares\\' and \\'data bridge\\' assets.\\n00\\nEXAMPLES OF APPLICATION\\nELASTACLOUD\\nA LEADING MULTI-NATIONAL ENERGY COMPANY Energy giant saves $10m a year through security upgrades\\nThe company wanted to centralise all its security information - and use it to :selected: Industry: Energe :unselected: Services & Solutions: Data Analytics Punturee generate valuable business intelligence. :selected: Technologies used Adure Data Explorer\\n1.

But we need to give people reason to trust and believe what we\\nsay by demonstrating our knowledge and leader role in the industry.\\nWe are successful, knowledgeable, expert, respected by our industry\\npeers, accomplished and self-assured ... but we must never sound\\n'cocksure' or arrogant.\\nWe call ourselves pioneers because we are brave, bold, adventurous,\\ncurious and always willing to challenge. We see ourselves as disruptors,\\neven maverick at times, and some might describe us as anti-\\nestablishment. We don't just accept things as they are if we believe\\nthere is a better way to do things, but we are never belligerent or\\naggressive. Determined with self-belief yes, rail-roading never.\\nWe are collaborators and partners. This means we are flexible,\\nco-operative, open-minded and non-judgemental. We are extremely\\n'human': friendly, approachable and accessible, not a faceless digital\\nbehemoth. We are proud of our playful, creative, sometimes quirky\\nculture and personality.\\nWe are 'woke', passionate and caring. We genuinely believe that\\ndata can be used to build a better world and to improve outcomes\\non a local and global scale. We want to be a force for good and we\\nlead by example. We care deeply about the welfare of our planet and\\nhumanity, firmly believing that we have an important role to play.\\nThe language we use shouldn't be overly jargon-heavy although\\nthe audience will generally be knowledgeable in the fields of data\\nand technology so needs to be respectful and mindful of that (not\\ncondescending or too dumbed down). Text needs to talk the language\\nof CIOs and data professionals, but also give them the language to\\nspeak to their CEO, CFO, Sustainability Officer or ESG Committee.\\nIt must strike a balance between clarity and over-simplification.\\nWe always speak in the plural (we, us, 'what we do', 'who we are').\\nWe can however refer to ourselves as Elastacloud and Elastaclouders.\"),\n",

If anyone said \"it can\\'t be\\ndone\", they said \"just watch us\", challenged the limits of\\nwhat \\'other experts\\' claimed was possible and usually did\\nit faster than anyone else.\\nThrough advanced analytics, data science, best practice\\ndevelopment in Al and cloud data architectures - as well\\nas research and development of sustainable business\\npractice and green technologies - Elastacloud continue to\\npioneer through data to deliver accelerated transformation\\nand game-changing insights and outcomes, fast.\\nThe Elastacloud way\\nSince 2011, we have been building our commitment to\\ninnovation, intelligent solutions and accelerated outcomes\\ninto a global business with teams of over 300 data experts\\nacross the UK, Spain, Brazil and India.\\nWe generally refer to our team members as\\n\\'Elastaclouders\\'. Our Elastaclouders consist of some of\\nthe finest data technologist talent around, and serve as\\nstrategic advisors to several of the world\\'s leading brands.\\nWe are highly respected and accomplished leaders in the\\ndata industry, with Richard and Andy recognised as present\\nMicrosoft Regional Directors and retired Microsoft Most\\nValuable Professionals.\\nJust like our founders have always done, we look at\\nthings differently and are willing to push against\\nconvention to improve outcomes: pioneering through\\ndata to deliver more sustainable operations and elevate\\nour clients with a competitive advantage and commercial\\nedge. Whatever their objectives - from sustainability\\nand growth to transformation - we push the boundaries\\nof possibility with a revolutionary approach and steely\\ndetermination to unshackle their data and harness the\\nopportunities it offers.\\nWe\\'re always searching for the beauty in data, operating\\nat a granular level and getting \\'up-close\\' with it, so that\\nwe are able to identify and unlock the gateways that sit\\nin plain sight. We look at every challenge from multiple\\nperspectives, never losing sight of the bigger picture or of\\nboth micro and macro points of view.\\nWe love to solve big problems and give people the freedom\\nto experiment, learn quickly, and share ideas with others.\\nWe see ourselves as challengers and disruptors, even\\nmaverick at times. We are not afraid of the unconventional\\nand encourage our teams to take on big challenges\\nthat could fail, so we can learn and continue striving for\\nbreakthrough outcomes.\\nWe champion shared experience, innovation, collaboration,\\nimagination, creativity, adventure, and opportunity. This is\\nbecause we actively encourage our people to look for bold,\\nalternative, and creative solutions - not just in delivery of\\nour ground-breaking, data solutions for clients, but also\\nthrough our unconventional recognition of the importance\\nof play and imagination.\\nOne example of this is the way that Elastaclouders working\\nacross four countries are encouraged to participate\\nand compete in company-wide \\'Dungeons & Dragons\\'\\ntournaments, run by our own in-house Dungeon Master.\\nSuch gameplay enhances \\'out-of-the-box\\' thinking, problem\\nsolving and confidence building as well as strengthening\\nrelationships between teams.\\nIt\\'s all of this combined that gives us a unique \\'magic sauce\\'.\\nA culture of giving back\\nElastacloud firmly believes that data can break boundaries\\nand benefit humanity, which is why we are heavily\\ninvested in projects and actions that improve outcomes\\nfor individuals and the planet. One way we do this is by\\nempowering our Elastaclouders to contribute to the wider\\ncommunity through sharing their digital skills.\\nFor well over a decade, Elastacloud has established and\\nmaintained various industry user groups: joining together\\nmore than 12,000 people around the world for community-\\nbased learning and innovation. This includes one of the\\nlargest data science communities in Europe.\\nWe are also proud to sponsor computer labs at Shanti\\nBhavan, a residential school in India for children born into\\nthe lowest socioeconomic class, which aims to uplift from\\npoverty through education and opportunity. Our team in\\nIndia run coding labs for the students there, sometimes\\nheld in the Elastacloud offices.\\nElastacloud has a deeply embedded commitment to\\ninclusivity, support, collaboration, nurturing and valuing\\nits people. Across the world, we actively encourage\\nElastaclouders to find a healthy balance of work and\\npersonal life: promoting time for self, family and friends,\\nfor leisure and wellbeing. In India for example, we\\ndon\\'t allow our teams to consistently work outside of\\nstandard operating hours, despite this generally being\\nthe expectation that people experience within Indian\\ncorporate culture.\\nWe take on graduates and experienced individuals from\\nall over (including from Shanti Bhavan) who possess the\\npassion and mindset to make a difference. \\'Elastaclouders\\'\\nare encouraged to invest at least an hour of their own time\\neach month to mentor and support children, teaching them\\nhow to code and advance their IT literacy. This instils our\\ngraduates with a sense of community: ensuring that our\\nvalues are passed on to more people and helping to embed\\nsustainable social equity within the technologies we work in.\\nSince 2020, Elastacloud has been a foundation sponsor of\\nThe National Museum of Computing, which is based on the\\nfamous Bletchley Park estate where the Enigma code was\\ncracked, turning the tide of the war. We\\'re active in a wide\\nvariety of events and activities at this inspiring educational\\nvenue; one that carries so much historical value and\\nsignificance to our industry.\\nAlthough our Elastaclouders are widely spread\\ngeographically, we are united by a culture of pioneering for\\nthe greater good: harnessing data to break boundaries and\\nbenefit our people and our world.'),\n",

We always apply the Elastacloud 'magic sauce' to deliver\\naccelerated outcomes.\\nThese sentiments should, wherever possible and appropriate, be represented through\\nthe unique styling of the visuals, brand assets and 'hero' imagery that we use in external\\n(and internal) communications and brand touch points (such as our website or sales\\nand marketing material). The way we present our visual imagery is by implementing a\\ncombination of three key components:\\n1. Use of solid brand colour 'data squares' to represent how Elastacloud intersects with\\nand benefits our world (whilst directly echoing the two data squares that drop into\\nthe E of our logo).\\n2. Use of a distinctive brand asset that we refer to as a 'data bridge'. This 'rainbow-\\nlike' coloured line (comprising a blend of the Elastacloud colour palette) is a visual\\nrepresentation of data flowing between points and intersecting with smaller 'data\\nsquares', overlaid on top of our hero images.\\n3. Use of exciting, intriguing, engaging, and stunningly detailed hero images of i)\\nclose-up nature shots and/or of ii) clients, people and industry. These images\\nare interchangeable depending upon the context they are being presented in and\\nwhat they are being used for, e.g. on a case study, sales deck or LinkedIn advert.\\nHero images can be either:\\ni) Close up images of nature to represent how Elastacloud gets up-close with\\ndata and operates at a granular level, to gain the understanding required to\\nprovide effective, fast solutions. We use super close-up natural images (flora and\\nfauna: animals, birds, plants, food etc.), to reveal the hidden detail, colour, texture,\\npattern and beauty (as well as repetition and connection) that becomes apparent\\nwhen magnified. This is a metaphor for how we work with data and is also a\\nreflection of our sustainability focus.\\nand/or\\nii) Macro images to reflect our client, people and industry expertise and\\nexperience, in order to show real-world applications of what we do and the\\nimpact we have on people and the planet.\"),\n",

       "'bp\\n4. Geology and geophysics\\n4.1 Geological summary\\n32\" Section\\n206/08-A21 was drilled from Slot 20 on the Clair Phase 1 Platform. The 32\" section drilled through the Otter Bank Sequence, Ferder Formation, Morrison Sequence and Sinclair Sequence before setting the shoe in the sands of the Westray Group at 390m MD, 390m TVDBRT.\\n17.1/2\" Section\\nThe 17.1/2\" section drilled the remaining Westray Group, the Balder Formation, and into the Cretaceous. The shoe was set at 1249m MD, 1180m TVDBRT in the upper part of the Cretaceous at the top of the Maastrichtian K90 sequence. This section comprised predominantly sands and thin mudstones, with the Cretaceous boundary marking a transition to mudstones. The formation tops came within 5mTVD of prognosis, with top Cretaceous 4mTVD shallow.\\n12.1/4\" Section\\nLarge quantities of cavings were recorded when cleaning out the rat-hole which cleaned up relatively quickly. A FIT was performed to 1.72sg EMW after drilling 3m of new formation. Drilling commenced in mudstones of the Late Maastrichtian K90.4 sequence and the K90.3 sequence (at 1275m MD -1131m TVDSS). The Early Maastrichtian K90.2 sequence at 1360m MD (-1202m TVDSS) was penetrated and picked using gamma ray. The Campanian K80.2 sequence was penetrated at 1785m MD (-1450m TVDSS), identified by an increase in the stick/slip suggesting a lithological change and was confirmed with LWD gamma ray. A small trace of angular and tabular cavings were recorded at 1840m MD, but quickly disappeared. Post well biostratigraphic analysis dated these cavings as Late Maastrichtian. Combined with the presence of cement the cavings are thought to have originated from the rat hole of the 17.1/2\" section. The Santonian K76 sequence at 1884m MD (-1502m TVDSS) was identified using gamma ray. The section comprised of mudstones with dolomitic limestone stringers. No WBS issues were recorded while drilling the Cretaceous mudstone sequences.\\nThe Upper Clair Group was penetrated at 2119m MD (-1625m TVDSS), identified from gamma ray and resistivity plus an influx of heavier gases. Heavy Minerals Analysis confirmed Upper Clair Group, Unit IX. The C_W2 fault was inferred at 2265m MD from a stuck pipe incident that occurred close to the prognosed fault depth. ROP began to reduce as the sandstones became tighter with depth, on occasion ROP being reduced to less than 1m/hr. The observation of fresh angular cavings resulted in early TD of the section being called within UCG Unit VII at 2588m MD (-1878m TVDSS) to limit further wellbore failure. Post-well biostratigraphic analysis dated these cavings as originating from the Early Maastrichtian / Late Campanian interval. More detail is provided in Section 7 - Wellbore stability.\\n8.1/2\" Section\\nThe remainder of the Upper Clair Group Unit VII was drilled, with the top Lower Clair Group, Unit Vlb picked on resistivity data and confirmed by Heavy Minerals at 2596m MD, (-1881m TVDSS), 44m TVD deeper than prognosed. Fault C_E1 was intersected at 2722m MD, (-1939.5m TVDSS) placing the well into Unit Vla.\\nTop Unit V (V.3) was identified at 2841m MD, (1983m TVDSS) which was 14m TVD shallower than prognosed. Unit V.2 was identified at 2979m MD and Unit V.1 at 3489m MD. Heavy minerals analysis revealed the well to be cutting down through Unit V and at 3520mMD the well entered the top of Unit IV. Unit V was seen between 3580m to 3600m suggesting a possible faulted re-entry to Unit V before returning\\n8\\nEOWR - 206/08/A21 (CP28)'"
